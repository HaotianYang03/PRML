## Pollen Classification using HSV + LBP Features

This project implements a traditional image classification pipeline on the POLLEN73S dataset using handcrafted features. It includes preprocessing for size and format normalization, feature extraction (color and texture), and classification using an SVM.

### ðŸ”§ Features
- Handles mixed image formats (JPG, TIFF) and sizes.
- Extracts HSV color histograms and LBP texture descriptors.
- Combines features and uses an SVM classifier for pollen classification.
- Achieves 88% accuracy on the test set over 73 pollen classes.
- Outputs a detailed classification report and auto-generates a Word table for visualization.
